## 🍎 Apple Developer Academy Project
Lesstrik was conceptualized and developed to solve a common household problem: *the lack of transparency and awareness regarding monthly electricity costs.* This project focuses on delivering a user-centric solution that transforms complex billing data into actionable insights.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Users log their current meter readings or specific appliance wattages.
2. **Calculate**: The app applies local electricity tariff formulas to the consumption data.
3. **Visualize**: Using **Swift Charts**, the app breaks down the data into easy-to-read visual reports, showing trends over days, weeks, or months.
